# Introduction

This is a project for Codecademy! It's part of my journey of learning frontend development one project at a time! The goal of this project was to create a site that is home to
various definitions, concepts, and templates reflecting what I've learned so far in the course!

# What I Used

I used the majority of HTML/CSS techniques learned in the frontend engineer path up to this project's point in the curriculum! Things like positioning, custom fonts, 
the box model, semantic HTML, CSS specificity, and much more!

# What I Learned

Through this project, I feel that I can confirm the fact that I've learned these concepts very well. In doing this project, I felt extremely confident in my HTML/CSS skills and
it has only made me more excited to become a frontend developer! I feel that through this project, I have solidified my grasp on positioning, the box model, clean code, 
semantic markup, padding/margin, and making readable layouts! I'm really proud of this project and I will be revisiting it to clean up my code as I learn and edit/create new sections
using future knowledge!

# Future Plans

I plan to come back into this site periodically and edit the layout and add new sections (new language sections, new terms, etc). One thing I think I can improve on is the 
responsiveness of the layout. More specifically, I want to incorporate flexbox into the site, but we haven't gotten to that point in the course at this moment so that will be
a future change!
